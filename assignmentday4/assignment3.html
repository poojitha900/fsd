        <h1>ABOUT FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT</h1>
        <p>Full stack development refers to the development of both front end and back end portions of an application.
             This web development process involves all three layer- Presentation layer(front end part that deals with the user interface),
              Business Logic Layer(back end part that deals with data validation) and the database Layer.
             It takes care of all the steps from the conception of an idea to the actual finished product.</p>
        
         <p>Having a specialist work on each of the different subsystems of web development process proves quite complex and expensive. 
            Companies are demanding full stack developers who are proficient in working across multiple stacks.</p>
